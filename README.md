Upload Page Dashboard with CSV File Upload and Display in Table Format with Pagination
This is a React project that serves as an Upload Page Dashboard where users can upload or drag and drop CSV files. The uploaded CSV file is read and the data is then displayed on a separate page in a table format with pagination. The application is styled using Material UI to provide a modern and visually appealing user interface.

Technologies Used
React JS: React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application efficiently.

Material UI: Material UI is a set of React components that implement Google's Material Design principles. It offers a wide range of pre-built, customizable components for building stylish and responsive user interfaces.

Features
Upload CSV File: Users can upload a CSV file from their local system by clicking on the upload button or by dragging and dropping the file onto the designated area.

CSV File Processing: Once a CSV file is uploaded, the application processes the data from the file and extracts the necessary information.

Routing to Display Page: After the data is successfully processed, the application routes to the display page, where the CSV data is presented in a tabular format.

Table Display with Pagination: The data is shown in a table format with pagination support. This ensures that the table is not overloaded with data and allows users to navigate through different pages.

How to Use
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/upload-page-dashboard.git
cd upload-page-dashboard
Install Dependencies: Use npm or yarn to install the project dependencies.
bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
Run the Application: Launch the development server to see the application in action.
bash
Copy code
npm start
# or
yarn start
Access the Application: Once the development server is up and running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Upload Page Dashboard.

Upload CSV File: On the dashboard, you will find a file upload area or a button labeled "Upload CSV." Click on it to select a CSV file from your computer or drag and drop a CSV file into the designated area.

View Data in Table Format: After the CSV file is successfully uploaded and processed, the application will redirect you to the Display Page. Here, you can view the data from the CSV file displayed in a tabular format.

Pagination: If the CSV file contains a large dataset, the table will be paginated, allowing you to navigate through different pages to view the data.

Styling
The application's user interface is styled using Material UI. Material UI provides pre-designed components with a Material Design theme, ensuring a clean and consistent look throughout the application. The styling is responsive, making the application usable on various devices and screen sizes.

Project Structure
The project's file structure might look something like this:

java
Copy code
upload-page-dashboard/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   ├── Upload.js
  │   │   ├── Edit.js
  │   │  
  │   ├── App.js
  │   ├── index.js
  │   └── styles.css
  ├── public/
  │   └── index.html
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  └── .gitignore
In this structure, Upload.js and Edit.js are React components responsible for handling the upload page and display page, respectively. The Pagination takes care of the pagination functionality.

App.js is the main component where routing and the overall logic of the application are managed. index.js is the entry point of the application. styles.css contains custom styles for the application, which complement the Material UI components.

Conclusion
This React project provides a simple yet efficient way for users to upload CSV files and view the data in a table format with pagination. The Material UI integration ensures an attractive and user-friendly interface. Developers can further extend this project by adding features like data filtering, sorting, or export options for the table.
